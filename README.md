# Adsorption_Game
An educational Java program
This Java program was written for educational purposes when I was working at the University of Calgary. It was developed based on the Applet class, which is now deprecated. That is why it is now redesigned based on the Frame AWT class. All necessary explanations and theoretical background are given in the files Game.html and CrashCourse.html.
To compile the code in the command line execute:

javac Game.java

with all other files (AmolComplex.java, Combinator.java, Configurations.java, LinearAlgebra.java, Orbitals.java, Score.java) in the same directory. To run the program execute:

java Game

You should see the window similar to the one in the Game.html page.
